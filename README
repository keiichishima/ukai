## Introduction

UKAI is an implementation of the concept of 'Centrally Controllable
Distributed Local Storage' as a virtual machine disk image storage.
UKAI provides a filesystem interface to a hypervisor.  A hypervisor
use the files stored in the UKAI filesystem as a virtual machine disk
image file.  The UKAI filesystem is not a POSIX filesystem.  It only
provides limited but enough set of filesystem operations for virtual
machine disk image storage.

The UKAI filesystem is a kind of distributed storage system.  Unlike
other major distributed file/storage systems, the UKAI filesystem is
not *autonomous* distributed system.  It is fully manual controlled
distributed filesystem.  You must configure which file should be
stored on which node.  In other words, you have full control on data
placement/replacement which is sometimes important when naive
management is required.

For example, assuming that you have geographically distributed
datacenters for virtualization services.  In that case, you may want
to migrate a virtual machie from a hypervisor to a different
hypervisor which is located far place geographically.  The disk image
of the virtual machine must be accessible from any location, but
probably you want some locallity for better disk I/O performance.
Using the UKAI filesystem, you can collect your virtual machine disk
image data to UKAI storage nodes located near to the running virtual
machine.


## Installation

UKAI is a Python program built on top of the [FUSE][] mechanism.  The
following software modules are required to run the UKAI filesystem.

* [Python][]: You know.
* [FUSE][]: Filesystem in Userspace.
* [fusepy][]: A Python module that provides a imple interface to FUSE.
* [netifaces][]: A portable access to network interfaces from Python.

In some environment, you may need to join the 'fuse' group and may
need to configure the '/etc/fuse.conf' file to include the following
line to disclose the filesystem to other users than the user running
the UKAI filesystem.

    user_allow_other


## Configuration

Before running the UKAI filesystem, you need to check the
'ukai_config.py' file and setup appropriate parameters defined in the
file.  The following parameters are configurable.

* image_root: The path where virtual machine disk image data is
  stored.
* metadata_root: The path where the metadata information of
  disk images is located.
* blockname_format: The filename format of each piece of blocks.
* control_port: The port number of the contorl interface to get/set
  internal information of the UKAI filesystem.
* proxy_port: The port number of the proxy program when receiving
  read/write requests from remote UKAI nodes.


## Prepare a Disk Image

At this moment, there is no handy way to prepare a disk image for the
UKAI filesystem.  You have to prepare all the necessary pieces by hand.

The things you have to do is the following two.

* Prepare a metadata file for a disk image
* Prepare files used as a storage space of the disk image


### Prepare Metadata

The metadata is represented in a JSON format like below.

    {
        "name": "image01",
        "size": 8000000000,
        "block_size": 50000000,
        "blocks": [
            {
                "192.168.0.100": {
                    "synced": true
                }
            },
            {
                "192.168.0.100": {
                    "synced": true
                }
            }
            (continue 158 times)
        ]
    }

The 'name' value is a name of the disk image.  The 'size' value is the
total size of the disk image.  In the above example, 8GB disk is
defined.  The 'block_size' value is the size of a block.  The disk
image will be divided into pieces of files based on the 'block_size'
value.  'blocks' is a list of location information of each block.
Each block can have multiple UKAI remote sotrage endpoint.  The
'synced' flag is declare if the data is up-to-date or not.

### Prepare a Disk Image Files

Once you've created the metadata file, put it to the
UKAIConfig['metadata_root'] path.

You also need to prepare initial disk image files as defined in the
metadata file.  In the above example, you have to prepare 160 files
under the UKAIConfig['image_root']/image01/ path of 192.168.0.100.
The filename of each block is defiend by
UKAIConfig['blockname_format'], defaults to '%016d'.  The block file
can have any contents since at the beginning, the contents doesn't
have any meaning.  You may create the files like below.

    for idx in `seq 0 159`
    do
        dd if=/dev/zero of=`printf %016d ${idx}`
    done


## Start the UKAI filesystem

To start the UKAI filesystem, you call the main function of the
'ukai.py' with the path to mount the filesystem.

    $ python ukai.py /ukai

You also need to run the same program under every UKAI remote nodes
defined in metadata files of your disk images.


## Insert a Disk Image
